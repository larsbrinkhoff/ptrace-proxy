ptproxy proxies debugging calls.

ptproxy spawns two children: a debugger and a program to be debugged.
ptproxy catches debugging calls from the debugger and forwards them
to the debugged program.  The results are passed back to the debugger.

To run ptproxy, Linux version >= 2.3.22 is needed.

A typical ptproxy session:

start ./ptproxy
[the child process prints its pid]
[gdb starts]
attach to the child
debug at will
